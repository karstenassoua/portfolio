          context={"I created Pascal to address the lack of intuitive, accessible math learning platforms. Many students, especially those studying independently, are underserved by existing tools. I wanted to build something that made learning math simpler and more engaging."} 
          problem={"Most math platforms are clunky, confusing, or inaccessible to students without strong institutional support, making self-study difficult and discouraging."} 
          solution={"Pascal is a web-based math resource I built to help students around the world self-study, get help with questions, and challenge themselves through clear video tutorials and guided walkthroughs."} 
          process={"I built Pascal using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Pug, along with Node.js, Express.js, and Bootstrap. I coded everything in Visual Studio Code, learning new frameworks and debugging as I went."} 
          outcomes={"I created a functional prototype that delivers educational content through a clean and accessible interface. Along the way, I developed full-stack skills and implemented features that laid the groundwork for future functionality like authentication and cloud integration."} 
          reflection={"This project taught me how to manage an end-to-end development process on my ownâ€”from ideation to deployment. I strengthened my skills in Node.js, Express.js, and UI design, and learned how to create educational content that puts user experience first."}
